COBOL_OS: The Funniest Vaporware Project Ever

So... You're probably here because you're either:
Bored as all hell
Tired of normal OS
Or wondering, "How the hell does one code an OS in COBOL?"

Or all three, even.
Currently this is a prototype of a prototype of a prototype. It is BEYOND alpha, it is hardly in development and I have written...
...approximately six line of COBOL as of this document.

...So, uh...

This is just here for me to be reminded about my project.
Thanks for visiting.
