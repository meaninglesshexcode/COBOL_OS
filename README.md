COBOL_OS: The Funniest Vaporware Project Ever

So... You're probably here because you're either:

Bored as all hell

Tired of normal OS

Or wondering, "How the hell does one code an OS in COBOL?"

Or all three, even.
Currently this is a prototype of a prototype of a prototype. It is BEYOND alpha, it is hardly in development and I have written...
...approximately six lines of COBOL as of this document.

...So, uh...

This is just here for me to be reminded (and feel guilty about) about my project.
Thanks for visiting.

PS:

I swear to GOD you MUST use GCOBOL for this. GnuCOBOL just *DOES NOT WORK* for this.

PPS:

nineteen lines.
